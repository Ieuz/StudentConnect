#Preperation
To install the dependencies, all you have to do is run pip install -r requirements.txt in python shell and all required 
software will be installed in the needed vesrion.
 
To allow the web app to run smoothly we must first populate the script using the command python population_script.py in 
the command prompt. Once the script has been populated(and all migrations have been made), the web app is fully functional 
and ready to take in new users.

To be able to access all aspects of our web app one must register with their student email, username, password... and once
registered successfully they must then log in. They will then be redirected to a welcome page where they will have the choice
to complete a multiple choice survey by clicking on the Find My Matches! button, once they press submit, matches will be found for them that they will later be able to look at on the my matches page.
